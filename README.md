# 🕹️ Flappy Bird (LibGDX)

This project is a Flappy Bird game developed using Java and LibGDX. Since I mostly developed console-based applications with Java, I wanted to create a real product and discovered the LibGDX library. This game was created to enhance my learning process and gain more knowledge about game development. 🎮
